2. Type `cd [directory_path]` into the command line to change to the desired directory.
3. Use the `find` command to search through all files in that directory for any file ending in `.py`. This will find all Python scripts in the directory. For example:

   cd Documents
   mkdir Compressed_Files
   echo ""Creating Compressed Files Directory...""
   touch CompressedFiles/CompressedFiles.txt
   ls -lh CompressedFile*
   exit
   `

3. Create a new text file named ""Compressed_files.txt"". This will contain a list of all the","1. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the .txt file(s) you want to compress.
2. Use the `ls` command to list all the text files in that directory. You can use wildcards to include subdirectories as well:

4,"List all files modified in the last 24 hours, sorted by modification time","1. First, make sure you have the latest version of your Bash or Zsh installation. You can check if you have it by running `bash --version` or `zsh -v`.

2. Next, create a new file called `last_modified_files.txt` and save it in your home directory. This will be the output file for the script.

5,Recursively search for files larger than 100MB and move them to a backup directory,"To recursively search and move files larger that 1 MB (1024 bytes) to a specific backup directory, you can use the following shell script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set up variables
backup_dir=""/path/to/backup""
file_ext="".zip""

if [[ -d $backupDir ]]; then
    echo ""Backup directory already exists.""
else
    mkdir -p $backuppath
fi

for file in $(find $backuptmp -type f -size +104857","To recursively search and move files larger then 1 MB to a new backup directory using the find command in Bash, you can use the following steps:

1. Create a new directory where you want to store your backup files. For example, let's say you want the backup directory to be called ""backup"".

2. Set up the environment variables for the current working directory (CWD) and the backup destination directory. You can do this by running the following commands:
   ```bash
   export CWD=""$(pwd)""
   mkdir -p ""$(dirname ""$BACKUP_",1,5,1,5,0.1373613563239035,0.4697986577181208,0.24489795918367346,0.33557046979865773

```
0 2 * * * /path/to/backup/script.sh
``` 
This will run the script at midnight on the second day of every month.

2. Create a new crontab file in your crontabs folder (usually located at `/etc/cron.d/` or `/var/spool/crons` depending on your system). Open it with a text editor and add the following lines:

```crontab","1. First, you need to create a new file called ""backup_schedule.sh"" in your home directory (e.g., /home/username). This script will be used as a cronjob.

2. Open the ""backups/backup.sh"", which is the main script that will be executed by the cronjob, and add the following lines:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set the backup schedule
if [ ""$1"" == ""hourly"" ]; then
  # Backup every hour
