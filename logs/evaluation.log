2025-06-18 02:09:43,735 - INFO - Generated plan: Create a new directory called 'project_backup'
Copy all .txt files from the current directory to 'project_backup'
List the contents of the backup directory using the following command:
ls 'project_backup'
Verify that the files were copied correctly by checking the contents of the backup directory:
ls 'project_backup'
```

Step 4:
To test the backup, open the terminal, navigate to the backup directory, and run the following command:

```
$ cd project_backup
$ cp . /mnt/backup/
$ cd /mnt/backup/
$ ls
```

Expected Output:
```
$ ls
