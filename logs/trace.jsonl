Open a terminal or command prompt window.\n2. Create a new directory for your Git repository by typing `mkdir my-git-repo` in the terminal or command prompt. For example, if your directory name is \"my-project\", replace \"my-project\" with the desired directory name.\n3. Navigate to the new directory you just created by typing \"cd my-project\" in the terminal or command prompt.\n4. Make a new Git repository by typing \"git init\" in the terminal or command prompt. This will create a repository with a default name and commit history.\n5. Commit your first commit by typing \"git add .\" in the terminal or command prompt. This will add all the files in your current directory to the commit history.\n6. Make your first commit by typing \"git commit -m \"First commit message\" \" in the terminal or command prompt. This will write a message in your commit history, and then commit the changes.\n7. Add your Git repository to the repository manager by using the `git remote add origin https://github.com/username/my-git-repo.git` command in the terminal or command prompt. Replace \"username\" and \"my-git-repo\" with your actual name and repository name.\n8. Push your changes to your Git repository by typing \"git push -u origin master\" in the terminal or command prompt. This will push your changes to the main branch (master) of your Git repository.\n9. Open a new terminal or command prompt and switch to the directory where your Git repository is located with the `cd` command.

Open another terminal or command prompt and switch back to the directory where your Git repository is located with the `cd` command. For example, if your directory is \"my-project\", replace \"my-project\" with the desired directory.\n13.
